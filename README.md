# Spotify-Songs-Analysis
My team and I, using R (ggplot, tidyverse, and more), looked at 5 datasets containing information about Top 200 Billboard songs or a random sample of songs from Spotify to visualize patterns for change over time and to classify a song's genre.

Here is a link to our final paper. It is an HTML file knitted from an R markdown file in RStudio.

While the final paper does not include any code, you can still view it through if interested through the original R file provided in this repo.
