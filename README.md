# Spotify-Songs-Analysis
My team and I, using R (ggplot, tidyverse, and more), looked at 5 datasets containing information about Top 200 Billboard songs or a random sample of songs from Spotify to visualize patterns for change over time and to classify a song's genre.

Please look through our RMD file knitted to HTML which is the final paper for our project. The original R file is also provided which shows our code.
